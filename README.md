# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my competitive programming practices.

## Timeline

### S1 2017
I participated in [FIT1045 programming competition](http://www.aamircheema.com/fit1045-pc/) (shout out to Aamir) and got 5th place:tada: at the end. <br />
At the same time, I also tried some problems on Codeforces.

### S2 2017
I joined [Monash Programming Team](http://monashicpc.com/) and I learnt a lot during the weekly lectures and practices. <br />(shout out to Darcy, Daniel, and [Cal](https://github.com/callistusystan):clap:)<br />
I also participated in several contests including: ANZAC, Google Kickstart, VCPC and ICPC.

### Now
I try to solve as many Codeforces problems as I can, starting from the [easiest ones](http://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC).<br />
I also start reading the book: [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/):green_book: by Steven Halim and Felix Halim.
